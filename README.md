[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/ff068d9259f949d8b68c4b74bfb1a4de)](https://www.codacy.com/app/kwpolska/achieve?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Kwpolska/achieve&utm_campaign=badger)

A task management/productivity web app, written in Django (Python). It loosely
follows GTD principles.

This project is currently in stagnation. It is generally finished for the web
part; the API was not started yet. A list of finished and unfinished features
is available below.

Setup
-----

Requirements: Python 3, PostgreSQL or SQLite3, nginx, uWSGI, Unix (Linux)

1. Pick a database engine and configure it in `achieveapp/settings.py`. I
   recommend PostgreSQL, but for small deployments SQLite3 will work well
   enough.
2. [Set up nginx and uWSGI][]. Put the app in `/srv/achieve`, use this
   repository for your `appdata`, and make sure to install `requirements.txt`.
   If you want to use PostgreSQL, `pip install psycopg2`.
   You will need the following environment variables:

        DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=achieveapp.settings
        DEBUG=0
        DB_TYPE=postgres   # or sqlite3
        SECRET_KEY=  # set to something random
        DB_PASSWORD=  # set to whatever your database password is (PostgreSQL)
        DJANGO_LOG_PATH=/srv/achieve/logs/django.log
        DJANGO_STATIC_ROOT=/srv/achieve/static

3. Create a `local-config` file that `export`s those variables (use something
   different for `DJANGO_LOG_PATH` and set `DEBUG=1`) to use `./manage.py`
4. Run the following commands:

        source local-config
        ./manage.py migrate
        ./manage.py collectstatic
        ./manage.py createsuperuser
5. Edit `templates/achieve/pub_index.html` and add some way to contact you for
   prospective new users (if you want those).
6. (Re)start nginx and uWSGI.
